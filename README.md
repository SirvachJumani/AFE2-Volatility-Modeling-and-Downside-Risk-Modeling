# Volatility-Modeling

1. First we load the EUROSTOXX50 dataset as a modern time series object into your working environment and plot it.
2. Then Use the AIC and autocorrelation tests to find an adequate ARMA-GARCH specification up to 5 lags for the log-returns. Also consider normal as well as t-distributed residuals.
4. Check the result support the premise of volatility clustering.
5. Use a GJR-GARCH(1,1) model to check whether we have leverage effects are present in the dataset.
6. Use an EGARCH(1,1) for the same purpose whether we have leverage effects are present in the dataset.
